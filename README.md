# Intern Plan: Cybersecurity RAG System using LLMs & Embeddings

This plan will outline a 9-week structured mentorship plan for an introduction to Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and Large Language Models. Aimed practical learning for vector search, backend development, and LLM/RAG application in InfoSec.

## Week-by-Week Plan

### Week 1 – Foundations of LLMs & RAG

**Goals:**
- Understand what LLMs are and how they work
- Learn about basics of transformers, embeddings, and RAG basics
- Find what llm can run on cpu

**Topics:**
- What are LLMs? (GPT, Mistral, LLaMA)
- Tokenization and embeddings
- What is RAG and why it matters in InfoSec

- Git & GitHub	Version control for your project repo	GitHub Docs > Hello World
- Python Basics	All glue code, APIs, and scripts will be in Python	> w3schools Python or RealPython
- Virtual Environments	> Keep packages clean for Python projects	python -m venv tutorial or RealPython guide
- Using APIs (REST)	Understand how FastAPI and HTTP requests work	> Intro to APIs or FastAPI crash course
- What is JSON?	Work with ticket data and APIs	> JSON Crash Course
